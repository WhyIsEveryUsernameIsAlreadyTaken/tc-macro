# tc-macro
warframe trade chat macro
multi dev project by me, TinyZach, and alembertian
(i did like nothing just made the base all credits to them xd)

tc macro.ahk is the base code which i made which is just the base copy paste every 2 minutes 
tclazy2.ahk is TinyZach's tc macro is an edit of mine with and alt-tab function
**IMPORTANT**
make sure you are in your dojo when sending messages as if not the chat will not close and you will have a "t" at the beginning of each message

update 1.) Tethy has made an edit to TinyZach's tcm which fixes some potential issues with inputs
