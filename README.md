# tc-macro
multi dev project by me, TinyZach, and alembertian
(i did like nothing just made the base all credits to them xd)

[tc macro](https://github.com/WhyIsEveryUsernameIsAlreadyTaken/tc-macro/blob/main/tc%20macro.ahk) is the base code which i made which is just the base copy paste every 2 minutes 
[tclazy2](https://github.com/WhyIsEveryUsernameIsAlreadyTaken/tc-macro/blob/main/tclazy2.ahk) is TinyZach's tc macro is an edit of mine with and alt-tab function
~~**IMPORTANT**
make sure you are in your dojo when sending messages as if not the chat will not close and you will have a "t" at the beginning of each message~~
this is no longer necessary in tclazy2 but still applies if for some reason you're using tclazy

Update 1.) 
- Tethys has made an edit to TinyZach's tcm which fixes some potential issues with inputs

Update 2.) 
- Added BlockInput function which fixes some issues with script functionality during message pasting

Update 3.)
- Added more alt tab functionality which brings back the last active window

Update 4.)
- Changes the storage of the copied message to be in a text file instead of using clipboard contents

Update 5.)
- Added a prompt asking if the user wants to replace the last saved message or continue with the last saved message
- Adds Mouse move functions to alt tab functionality, returning the mouse cursor to its original position
