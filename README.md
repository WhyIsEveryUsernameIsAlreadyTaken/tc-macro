# tc-macro
warframe trade chat macro
multi dev project by me, TinyZach, and alembertian
(i did like nothing just made the base all credits to them xd)

tc macro.ahk is the base code which i made which is just the base copy paste every 2 minutes 
tclazy2.ahk is TinyZach's tc macro is an edit of mine with and alt-tab function

for tc macro.ahk press ctrl+j to start the macro and it will automatically paste your message in every 2 minutes
for tclazy2.ahk press ctrl+j to start the macro, then copy your message off a notepad and it will start pasting in trade chat

update 1.) Tethy has made an edit to TinyZach's tcm which fixes some potential issues with inputs
